This project explores Google Search data by country-wise for 5 years time period using Python. It follows the structure of a full data science pipeline: cleaning, analyzing, segmenting, and visualizing the dataset.

## 🧪 Project Steps

### 1. 🧹 Data Loading & Pre-processing  
- Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame  
- Clean missing values and duplicates  
- Convert data types (e.g. numeric conversion for installs and price)  
- Remove outliers and fix inconsistent categories

### 2. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Analyze app distribution by category and type  
- Visualize trends in ratings, reviews, installs  
- Identify top-performing app segments  
- Group and compare metrics by app category

### 3. 🔍 Data Profiling  
- Perform automated data profiling  
- View correlations, missing data, distribution shapes  
- Gain a quick high-level overview of dataset quality and patterns

### 4. 📈 Advanced Visualizations  
- Create meaningful bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps  
- Build interactive visuals to explore relationships (e.g. Reviews vs Installs)  
- Highlight top apps by installs, rating, and reviews  
- Compare free vs paid app performance

### 5. 🤖 Clustering & Segmentation  
- Apply K-Means to group apps by metrics like installs, reviews, price  
- Discover patterns between similar apps  
- Use clustering results to interpret app types and market positions

### 6. 🧠 Feature Engineering & PCA  
- Create new features like normalized installs or price per review  
- Reduce dimensionality using PCA for better visualization  
- Identify key principal components in the data
